# React-job-tracker
Basic React project, using Chakra UI, bootstrap, Axios. 
Planning to implement unit, and specflow acceptance testing for this application
Just to get an understanding of the development process to be able to thoroughly test React projects


## Prerequites
- In order to run this service, you'll need to clone the back-end and set up service to this repo. Be sure to set that back end service up and that it's up and running before you start this service. 
- Make sure you have these dependencies on locally downloaded on your machine
    - Node.js
    - Chakra UI
    - Axios

## How to run this service
Assuming you have the back end service all ready and set up (if you do not I will have the tutorial in the backened serivce). To run this service start in the root folder and navigate to directory 'job-tracker'. Run 'npm install' to install all dependencies on to your local project, run 'npm run dev'.. If you've successfully started up the back end repo, the browser with URI "http://localhost:5000" should spin up. You're ready to go!
